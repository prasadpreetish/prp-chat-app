# Chat App - React.js & Node.js

This is a chat application built using React.js for the client-side and Node.js for the server-side. It allows users to engage in real-time chat with each other.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org) - To run the server and client applications.
- npm (Node Package Manager) - It comes bundled with Node.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the chat app:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install dependencies for the client application:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

3. Install dependencies for the server application:

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the chat app, follow these steps:

1. Start the server:

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

2. In a new terminal or command prompt, start the client:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

3. The client-side application will open in your default web browser. If it doesn't automatically open, you can manually access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

4. Now you should be able to use the chat app, create an account or log in, and start chatting with other users!

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors during installation or while running the app, make sure you have followed all the installation steps correctly, and all the dependencies are installed.
- If the client-side application doesn't open automatically, try accessing it manually by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
